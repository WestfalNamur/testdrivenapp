AWS

	AWS Security Group
		Virtual firewall to control traffic to and from instance;
	
	IAM user
		 Identity and Access Management;
		 Part of a group with defined permissions;
		 Has access-key and secret-key

Bash
	
	eval [arg ...]
    The  args  are read and concatenated together into a single command. This
    command is then read and executed by the shell, and its  exit status is
    returned as the value of eval.  If there are no args, or only null
    arguments, eval returns 0;
	i.e. eval $(docker-machine env testdriven-prod);

Docker

	Docker
		Docker Engine (Client-server application made up of the Docker daemon)
		+ REST API that specifies interfaces for interacting with the daemon;

	Docker Engine
		Usually referred to as "Docker";
		Client-server application made up of the Docker daemon;

	Docker Compose
		Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications;
		Use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services;
		1. Define app-env with a Dockerfile;
		2. Define services with docker-compose.yml so they can be run together in
		   an isolated environment;
		3. "docker-compose up" to run app
		"docker-compose build" build image from Dockerfile;
		"docker-compose up -d --build" fires up container;
		"docker-compose logs";
		"docker-compose exec users python manage.py test" executes commands
		 	defined in manage.py;
	 
	Docker Machine
		Tool that lets you install Docker Engine on virtual hosts;
		"docker-machine env <HOSTNAME>" to point at host <HOSTNAME>
		example create:
			docker-machine create \
			--amazonec2-access-key AKIXXXXXXX \
			--amazonec2-secret-key XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
			--driver amazonec2 --amazonec2-region eu-central-1 \
			--amazonec2-instance-type "t2.micro" \
			docker-egine-name
		point to engine:
			"docker-machine env docker-egine-name" set active host
			"eval $(docker-machine env testdriven-prod)"
			Selection indicated by *
		"docker-machine ls --timeout "120"" # timeout extended in case of slow
			connection.

	Docker Image
		Created by sequence of commands written in a file called as Dockerfile;
		An image is a compressed, self-contained piece of software which has to be
	unwrapped in order to use the functionality;

Flask
	
	Blueprint
		A blueprint defines a collection of views, templates, static files and
		other elements that can be applied to an application;

	request
		Data from client gets sent to server as global request object;
		flask.request lets you process this pbject;

	render_template
		Flask functionality to render a template;

Gunicorn
	Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX; Interacts with nginx and actual python
	web-app code to serve dynamical content;
	Pre-fork worker model:
		Master creates forks which handle each request; A fork is a completely
		separate *nix process; "pre-fork" means that these processes are forked
		before a request comes in;
	Gevent:
		workers-threads are asynchronous;

Nginx
	Web-server,reverse proxy, HTTP cache, and load balancer; 
	# for serving static content;
	Low memory; High concurrency; Asynchronous event-driven; Requests are
	handled in a single thread; Master porcess controls multiple worker
	processes;
